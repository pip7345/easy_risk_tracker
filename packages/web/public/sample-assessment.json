    "Pyramid/MLM structure indicators: rank system, binary team build, multi-level referral commissions (e.g., 7-level referral model) and repeated promo-driven recruitment language",
    "Investment-like marketing: emphasis on passive income/daily earnings, 'wealth engine', 'ownership compounds', and aggressive limited-time promo urgency",
    "Tokenomics opacity: no clear public documentation of PNIC/MIRX/MIR token supply, emissions, vesting, treasury, or burn mechanics beyond marketing claims",
    "Revenue-share claims without verifiable on-chain/financial proof: statements like '$15,000/day fees', '90% of chain fees to nodes', '50% of transaction fees to nodes' not independently evidenced in provided data",
    "Liquidity/market uncertainty: no disclosed liquidity sources, lock status, market depth, or transparent exchange/liquidity reporting; reliance on internal 'Reward Center' and package purchases",
    "Centralized operational control risk: reward claim pauses/maintenance and platform-controlled reward center balances imply custodial/centralized dependencies",
    "Paywalled/gated key details: compensation plan and key mechanics referenced as located in back office; reduces transparency",
    "Potential undisclosed/unclear token relationships: multiple tokens referenced (PNIC, MIRX, MIR, Phoenix/Phoenic) with shifting roles (gas, staking, rewards) and migrations, increasing complexity and disclosure risk"

  "notes": "Assessment is based on the provided project materials (site/social links not independently verified here). Bellator presents as a crypto-fintech + node/NFT + education ecosystem, but the earning model heavily incorporates multi-level referral structures (ranks, binary, 7-level commissions) and package promotions, which is consistent with MLM-style distribution. This triggers the methodology’s Automatic Critical Risk condition for pyramid/recruitment-based compensation, overriding the weighted score outcome. Tokenomics and liquidity are insufficiently disclosed (supply/emissions/vesting/treasury/liquidity lock status not provided; compensation plan appears gated in back office). Technical claims (Miracle Chain migration, RPC/explorer links, staking) suggest some implementation exists, but audits, open-source repos, and independently verifiable fee/revenue metrics are not provided. Overall risk is dominated by compensation-structure and disclosure gaps rather than purely technical execution.",
  "improvement_framework": {
    "leadership_team": "Publish a verifiable leadership roster (legal names, roles, corporate entities, jurisdictions), plus third-party background/track-record references. Clarify whether named figures are formal officers/directors with fiduciary responsibility vs. advisors/marketing. Provide corporate filings for any claimed public listing path (OTC/NASDAQ) with links to regulators/filings.",
    "tokenomics": "Release a complete tokenomics paper for each token (PNIC, MIRX, MIR/other): total supply, circulating supply, mint authority, emissions schedule, staking yield source, vesting/lockups, treasury wallets, burn rules, and how migrations preserve holder rights. Provide on-chain addresses and dashboards for treasury and emissions.",
    "earning_mechanism": "Remove or materially de-emphasize recruitment-based compensation (deep-level referral trees, binary, rank bonuses tied to team building). If rewards are truly fee-based, redesign payouts to be usage/fee driven with transparent formulas and publish audited revenue-share statements. Add clear risk disclosures and avoid 'passive income' framing.",
    "liquidity_market": "Disclose where tokens trade, current liquidity, market makers (if any), and provide proof of liquidity provisioning and lock status. Publish treasury/liquidity wallets and a policy for buybacks/burns (if applicable). Provide a clear redemption/exit pathway that does not rely on internal dashboards.",
    "community_reputation": "Commission independent reviews and publish balanced community reporting (complaints, incident history, resolution metrics). Establish a public incident log (downtime, payout delays, migrations) and a formal support SLA.",
    "technical_quality": "Publish technical documentation for Miracle Chain (consensus, validators, security model), node requirements, and staking contracts. Obtain reputable third-party smart contract audits and publish reports. Open-source critical components or provide reproducible builds and security disclosures.",
    "transparency": "Move key documents out of gated back offices: compensation plan, terms, risk disclosures, tokenomics, and legal entities. Provide regular financial transparency reports (fee revenue, payouts, reserves) with third-party attestations. Clearly label marketing vs. audited facts.",
    "personal_assessment": "Treat as speculative/high-risk until (1) recruitment-based compensation is removed, (2) tokenomics/liquidity are fully disclosed, and (3) revenue-share claims are independently verifiable. Limit exposure, avoid locking funds, and require documentary proof for any listing/licensing/insurance claims."
