# BehindMLM

## Project Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Name** | BehindMLM |
| **Category** | Investigative Blog / Review Site |
| **Website** | [behindmlm.com](https://behindmlm.com/) |
| **iiZR Analyst** | Miqoshi Onvani (platform analyst, not site leadership) |
| **Notes** | This is not an investment project; it is an informational watchdog site. |

## Summary

BehindMLM is an independent investigative blog focused on reviewing MLM and related schemes. It does not appear to be an investment product, token, or platform for earning yield. As a result, the Easy Risk Tracker scoring framework does not apply here.

## Risk Rating

**N/A – Informational Site (Not an investment product)**

## Why No Score?

The Easy Risk Tracker is designed for **investment products** (tokens, DeFi platforms, yield programs, or financial services). BehindMLM is a **news and analysis site** with no token, no yield mechanism, and no liquidity considerations. Applying the investment risk rubric would be misleading.

## Suggested Use

- Use as a **research and due‑diligence source** for MLM-related claims.
- Cross-reference allegations with primary documents and regulatory filings when possible.
