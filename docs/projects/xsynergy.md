## Project Description

Xsynergy describes itself as a "trustless reward engine that turns USDT into daily earnings." The platform offers two mechanisms: Time-Mining ("lock USDT, earn $XSYN proportional to lockup") and Vault Staking ("stake $XSYN, earn USDT from protocol activity"). Claims to be fee-light, fully on-chain, and non-custodial.

## Scam Risk Assessment ⚠️

This project exhibits multiple characteristics of a potential rug pull or Ponzi scheme:
- Anonymous team with access to user USDT
- Promises of daily yields without clear revenue source
- Lock-up periods that prevent immediate exit
- No audit trail or accountability

**DO NOT DEPOSIT FUNDS without extensive due diligence beyond this assessment.**
