## 🚨 Red Flags & Concerns

<div className="red-flags">

### Moderate Concerns Identified

1. **Token Unlock Risk**: ~29% of circulating supply unlocked in October 2025 - potential sell pressure

2. **Bandwidth Privacy Concerns**: Users sharing residential IP addresses for web scraping - potential misuse risks

3. **Points System Complexity**: Recent changes splitting into "Uptime Points" and "Network Points" may confuse users

4. **Competitive Space**: Multiple bandwidth-sharing projects competing (including Uprock, Honeygain)

5. **Centralized Components**: Wynd Labs as service provider creates some centralization risk

</div>

---

## ✅ Positive Indicators

<div className="green-flags">

1. **Significant Funding**: $10M bridging round from Polychain Capital and Tribe Capital

2. **Treasury Management**: $250,000 + $100,000 in open-market GRASS purchases strengthening reserves

3. **Token Already Live**: GRASS token trading on exchanges (unlike many competitors still in pre-token)

4. **Strong Revenue Model**: Enterprise clients paying for web data access - real business revenue

5. **Mobile Expansion**: Android app driving 38% of network activity - growing accessibility

6. **Transparent Communication**: Token Holder Calls with business updates, open Q&A

## 📝 Verdict

**Risk Tier: 🟡 Moderate (7.2/10)** - Approaching Low Risk

Grass is a solid DePIN project with real products, enterprise revenue, and transparent communication. The token is live and actively traded, which provides more data for evaluation than pre-token projects.

**Suitable For:**
- Users with spare bandwidth who understand DePIN economics
- Those seeking passive crypto earning through legitimate resource sharing
- Users comfortable with bandwidth/proxy technology
- Long-term holders who can weather token unlock volatility

**Not Suitable For:**
- Users with limited bandwidth or data caps
- Those uncomfortable with residential IP sharing
- Short-term traders concerned about unlock events
- Privacy-focused users unwilling to share bandwidth

**Recommendation:** Grass is one of the stronger options in the DePIN bandwidth space. Participate with realistic expectations about earnings (depends on location, connection quality, and network demand). Monitor the October 2025 token unlock closely. The Android app provides easy entry for mobile-first users.
