## 🚨 Critical Red Flags

### Impossible Investment Claims
- **"Upside without downside"** - This is financially impossible
- **"Wealth that grows without exposure to market loss"** - No such investment exists
- **"Market loss protection"** - Legitimate only in specific, expensive products
- These claims violate basic investment principles

### EmployWell Program Concerns
- Claims to save "$700+ per employee per year"
- Promises to "increase employees' pay by 2.7% — at no cost"
- "Add extra medical benefits — for free"
- "If you don't save — you don't pay" guarantee
- Claims are extraordinary and likely misrepresented

### MLM-Style Marketing
- Heavy use of rhetorical questions
- "This Message Is For You!" urgency language
- "Let's find out how much your company could save today" call-to-action
- Emotional appeals to business owners
- Subscription wall for "insights" (information gate)

### Infinite Banking Red Flag
- "Infinite Banking" is a controversial strategy often oversold
- Typically involves whole life insurance with high commissions
- Benefits often overstated to retail consumers
- Complex products sold to unsophisticated buyers

## Recommendations

### ⚠️ HIGH CAUTION - Verify Before Engaging

1. **Before Any Engagement:**
   - Verify Andre' Normann's licensing (insurance, securities, etc.)
   - Request independent verification of EmployWell Program claims
   - Understand "infinite banking" involves whole life insurance policies
   - Get any savings claims in writing with methodology

2. **Red Flag Awareness:**
   - No investment offers "upside without downside"
   - High commissions are common in whole life insurance
   - "Market loss protection" has significant costs
   - Free benefits claims need scrutiny

3. **Due Diligence Steps:**
   - Check state insurance commissioner for licensing
   - Request sample client results with verification
   - Understand all fees and commissions
   - Consult independent financial advisor before committing

4. **EmployWell Program Verification:**
   - Request program documentation before engagement
   - Verify IRS compliance claims independently
   - Get references from current program participants
   - Understand "no cost" fine print

## Verdict

**🟠 HIGH RISK (4.0/10)** - Masterwealthbuilders LLC makes financially impossible claims including "upside without downside" and "wealth that grows without exposure to market loss." These statements are red flags indicating either misrepresentation or extremely high-cost structured products. The "infinite banking" strategy often involves high-commission whole life insurance products that benefit sellers more than buyers. The EmployWell Program claims of saving "$700+ per employee" and adding benefits "for free" require independent verification. While this appears to be a legitimate LLC rather than a cryptocurrency scam, the marketing claims should not be taken at face value. Proceed with extreme caution and verify all licensing and claims before any engagement.
