| Field | Value |

| **Name** | Amplivo / Corsair |
| **Category** | Fintech / CSR Token / Circular Economy |
| **Website** | [amplivo.com](https://amplivo.com/) |
| **Status** | Active |

## Description

Amplivo is a community-driven platform that empowers individuals to participate in a mission to reduce plastic waste while earning through its referral-based model. Corsair Group International positions itself as the industrial engine behind that mission, claiming to convert plastic waste into usable fuel through pyrolysis technology. Together, they present a narrative where community engagement fuels environmental impact and tokenized value creation. They promote a circular economy where collective action and innovative processing create both environmental and financial benefits.

## Risk Assessment

### 🟠 Overall Risk: HIGH RISK
**Final Weighted Score: 4.8/10**

### Category Breakdown

#### 1. Leadership & Team (Weight: 15%) - Score: 5/10
| Criteria | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| Public Identity | ⚠️ Admins identified (Patty Edgecombe, Andre' Normann), CEO Jussi Saloranta mentioned |
| Professional Background | ⚠️ Limited verifiable professional history for leadership |
| Track Record | ⚠️ No prior successful project history documented |
| Community Engagement | ✅ Regular updates and global calls with CEO |

**Justification:** Leadership is partially visible with named individuals and CEO involvement. However, professional backgrounds are not independently verifiable, and there's limited track record of previous successful ventures.

---

#### 2. Tokenomics & Financials (Weight: 15%) - Score: 4/10
| Criteria | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| Token Utility | ⚠️ CSR Token - listed on CoinGecko/CoinMarketCap |
| Supply Distribution | ❓ Not clearly documented |
| Revenue Model | 🔴 Heavy reliance on referral-based model and crowdfunding |
| Vesting Schedule | ❓ Not disclosed |

**Justification:** The CSR token exists and has basic exchange listings, but the underlying economics heavily depend on referral compensation and crowdfunding rather than sustainable product revenue. Token supply distribution is not transparent.

---

#### 3. Earning Mechanism (Weight: 10%) - Score: 3/10
| Criteria | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| Revenue Source | 🔴 Primarily referral-based compensation |
| Sustainability | 🔴 MLM-style structure concerning |
| Payout History | ❓ Not verified |
| Model Clarity | ⚠️ "Competitive compensation package" mentioned without details |

**Justification:** The earning model is explicitly referral-based with "partners" earning through recruitment. This MLM-style structure raises significant red flags. Claims of "plastic credits" revenue are unverified.

---

#### 4. Liquidity & Exit Options (Weight: 20%) - Score: 4/10
| Criteria | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| Exchange Listings | ⚠️ CoinGecko/CoinMarketCap listed but limited DEX liquidity likely |
| Withdrawal History | ❓ Not documented |
| Lock-up Periods | ❓ Crowdfunding participation terms unclear |
| Exit Mechanism | ⚠️ Equity via crowdfunding; token on limited exchanges |

**Justification:** CSR token has basic listings but liquidity depth is questionable. Crowdfunding participants become "shareholders" but exit mechanisms and share liquidity are unclear.

---

#### 5. Community & Sentiment (Weight: 10%) - Score: 5/10
| Criteria | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| Community Size | ⚠️ "Global network" claimed, actual size unknown |
| Engagement Quality | ✅ Regular updates, video content, events (Thailand) |
| Sentiment | ⚠️ 4 upvotes / 0 downvotes on platform (limited sample) |
| Red Flags | 🔴 MLM-style language throughout marketing |

**Justification:** Active community engagement with regular updates and events. However, MLM-style marketing language ("3 stars and above") and recruitment focus are concerning.

---

#### 6. Technical Infrastructure (Weight: 15%) - Score: 5/10
| Criteria | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| Product Existence | ⚠️ Claims pyrolysis facilities but independent verification lacking |
| Smart Contract Audit | ❓ No audit mentioned |
| Security Track Record | ❓ Unknown |
| Technical Documentation | ⚠️ Marketing-heavy, technical details sparse |

**Justification:** Claims operational recycling facilities converting plastic to fuel, but no independent verification of facilities or operations. No smart contract audits disclosed for CSR token.

---

#### 7. Transparency & Communication (Weight: 10%) - Score: 6/10
| Criteria | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| Regular Updates | ✅ Frequent updates (8-day to 6-month range) |
| Financial Disclosures | 🔴 No audited financials available |
| Roadmap Clarity | ⚠️ Vague expansion goals (1 billion liters pyrolysis oil) |
| Response to Criticism | ❓ Not documented |

**Justification:** Regular updates and CEO communications are positive. However, financial transparency is lacking with no audited statements, and business claims are not independently verifiable.

---

#### 8. Personal Investment Factors (Weight: 5%) - Score: 4/10
| Criteria | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| Entry Cost | ⚠️ Crowdfunding participation required for equity |
| Complexity | ⚠️ Multi-entity structure (Amplivo + Corsair + Foundation) confusing |
| Time Commitment | ⚠️ Partner model requires active recruitment |

**Justification:** Complex multi-entity structure with recruitment-based earning requires significant time investment and potentially upfront capital.

## 🚨 Major Red Flags

1. **MLM-Style Structure**: Heavy emphasis on referral compensation and "partner" recruitment with rank systems ("3 stars and above")
2. **Unverifiable Claims**: Pyrolysis facilities and plastic credit operations not independently verified
3. **Crowdfunding Dependency**: Business model heavily reliant on retail investor crowdfunding
4. **Complex Entity Structure**: Multiple entities (Amplivo, Corsair Group, Corsair Foundation) create confusion and potential liability shields
5. **Vague Revenue Model**: Unclear how actual revenue is generated beyond recruitment
6. **No Financial Audits**: No audited financial statements despite claims of operational facilities

---

## ✅ Improvement Steps

1. **Independent Verification**: Obtain third-party audits of pyrolysis facilities and operations
2. **Financial Transparency**: Publish audited financial statements showing actual revenue from plastic credits vs. recruitment
3. **Smart Contract Audit**: Commission security audit for CSR token smart contract
4. **Clear Compensation Disclosure**: Publish detailed income disclosure statement showing what typical participants earn
5. **Regulatory Compliance**: Clarify securities registration status for equity crowdfunding offerings
6. **Remove MLM Elements**: Restructure compensation to focus on product revenue rather than recruitment

---

## Verdict

🟠 **HIGH RISK** - Amplivo/Corsair presents a concerning combination of environmental claims, tokenization, and MLM-style recruitment. While the environmental mission is noble, the business model heavily emphasizes recruitment and lacks independent verification of core operations. Potential investors should exercise extreme caution and demand verifiable proof of pyrolysis operations and actual plastic credit revenue before participating.
