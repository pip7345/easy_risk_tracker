## Project Description

ZPLN is a mobile gaming platform that merges entertainment, competition, and crypto rewards. The flagship game is a "psychedelic, space-based target-shooting strategy game" powered by the ZPLN token, described as a "zero-point light node" designed to grow in value as the community expands. Players can mine ZPLN tokens through gameplay, compete for crypto prizes (BONK, LEARN tokens), and participate in blockchain-based events. The platform features free-to-play games with referral incentives and an upcoming paid "Echo" product ($35) with MLM-style compensation.

## Risk Assessment Scoring

### 1. Leadership & Team Transparency (15%)
| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Founders publicly identified | 4/10 | Andre' Normann actively posts updates; no LinkedIn/background |
| Team background verifiable | 3/10 | Admin profiles visible but no professional verification |
| Advisory board disclosed | 2/10 | No advisory board mentioned |
| Company registration transparent | 2/10 | No company registration or legal entity disclosed |

**Category Score: 2.75/10**

*Justification: While Andre' Normann is active and communicative, there's no verifiable professional background, company registration, or legal entity disclosed. The team appears to be small and informal.*

### 2. Tokenomics & Financial Model (15%)
| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Clear token utility | 5/10 | ZPLN used for game entry fees, prizes, and mining |
| Sustainable revenue model | 3/10 | Revenue depends on user growth; Echo product at $35 adds income |
| Token distribution transparency | 4/10 | Pre-mining phase with 100M target mentioned |
| Vesting schedules disclosed | 4/10 | Token will be tradable after 100M mined |

**Category Score: 4.0/10**

*Justification: The token has clear gaming utility but the economic model depends heavily on continuous user growth. The "Echo" product launch suggests they're trying to create additional revenue streams, though MLM-style compensation is concerning.*

### 3. Earning Mechanism & Sustainability (10%)
| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Clear source of yields | 4/10 | Gameplay mining, blockchain event prizes (BONK, LEARN) |
| Realistic return promises | 4/10 | Prizes appear modest; no unrealistic yield promises |
| Withdrawal mechanisms clear | 5/10 | Solana wallet withdrawals mentioned; Phantom integration |
| Historical payout evidence | 5/10 | Multiple updates show blockchain events paying real tokens |

**Category Score: 4.5/10**

*Justification: The earning mechanism through gameplay and tournaments is clearer than pure yield farming. Blockchain events with real token prizes (BONK, LEARN) provide some credibility. However, the MLM-style Echo product is concerning.*

### 4. Liquidity & Exit Options (20%)
| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Exchange listings | 3/10 | ZPLN not yet tradable; waiting for 100M mining milestone |
| Liquidity pool depth | 2/10 | Token not yet on blockchain; no liquidity pools |
| Withdrawal restrictions | 5/10 | Other tokens (BONK, LEARN) can be withdrawn to Phantom wallet |
| Exit clarity | 4/10 | Pre-mining phase with clear milestone for trading |

**Category Score: 3.5/10**

*Justification: ZPLN token is still in pre-mining phase and not yet tradable. However, prize tokens from blockchain events (BONK, LEARN) can be withdrawn immediately. The 100M mining target before trading is a clear but unproven milestone.*

### 5. Community & Social Proof (10%)
| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Active community size | 5/10 | Active updates, "VIP" referral system suggests active base |
| Social media presence | 4/10 | No direct social links but active communication |
| Community engagement quality | 6/10 | 7 upvotes, 0 downvotes; regular detailed updates |
| User testimonials | 4/10 | No external testimonials but internal engagement visible |

**Category Score: 4.75/10**

*Justification: The project has active communication with 15+ detailed updates over 3 months. Community engagement exists but the heavy focus on referrals ("VIP invites") suggests MLM-style growth dependency.*

### 6. Technical & Security (15%)
| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Smart contract audits | N/A | No audit information provided |
| Security track record | 4/10 | App live on Google Play and iOS; no reported hacks |
| Technical documentation | 3/10 | Limited technical details; mostly marketing content |
| Open source code | N/A | No GitHub or code repository mentioned |

**Category Score: 3.5/10** (adjusted for N/A items)

*Justification: The app is live on both app stores which provides some legitimacy. However, no security audits, technical documentation, or open source code is available. Multiple mentions of "bugs" and "glitches" suggest early-stage development.*

### 7. Transparency & Communication (10%)
| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Regular updates | 8/10 | Very frequent updates (15+ over 3 months) |
| Clear roadmap | 5/10 | Echo launch, blockchain events, Zenduja card game planned |
| Financial reporting | 2/10 | No financial transparency or treasury reports |
| Response to concerns | 6/10 | Updates address technical issues proactively |

**Category Score: 5.25/10**

*Justification: Communication is a strength - Andre' Normann provides frequent, detailed updates including honest mentions of technical issues. However, no financial transparency exists and the roadmap is informal.*

### 8. Personal Investment Factors (5%)
| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Alignment with risk tolerance | 4/10 | High risk but limited monetary investment required |
| Affordability of loss | 6/10 | Free-to-play entry; Echo costs only $35 |
| Understand the technology | 4/10 | Gaming concept is accessible but token value unclear |

**Category Score: 4.7/10**

*Justification: The low barrier to entry (free-to-play, $35 Echo) reduces absolute risk exposure. However, time investment could be significant for uncertain returns.*

---

## Risk Rating: 🟠 HIGH RISK

This is an early-stage play-to-earn project with active development but significant concerns around tokenomics and MLM-style structures.

---

## Major Red Flags 🚩

1. **MLM-Style Compensation**: "Echo" product ($35) with "MONSTER compensation plan" and "check match percentages" - classic MLM language
2. **Token Not Yet Tradable**: ZPLN cannot be traded until 100M tokens are mined - locks user value
3. **Referral-Heavy Growth**: "VIP invites," "Starborn" ranks, referral requirements to access features
4. **No Legal Entity**: No company registration or legal structure disclosed
5. **Frequent Technical Issues**: Multiple updates mention bugs and glitches
6. **Recruitment Locks**: "Everyone that does not have 3 active on their sector 1 will be locked out of all blockchain and cash events"
7. **Unverified Team**: No professional backgrounds or LinkedIn profiles for leadership
8. **No Security Audits**: No smart contract audits for token or app security

---

## Positive Indicators ✅

1. **Active Development**: Regular app updates and bug fixes
2. **Transparent Communication**: Honest about technical issues
3. **Real Token Prizes**: BONK, LEARN tokens are real and withdrawable
4. **Low Entry Cost**: Free-to-play base; $35 maximum for premium
5. **App Store Presence**: Live on both Google Play and iOS
6. **Clear Milestones**: 100M mining target before trading is specific

---

## Steps to Improve Score

1. **Establish Legal Entity**: Register a proper company with transparent corporate structure
2. **Remove MLM Elements**: Eliminate multi-level compensation structures from Echo
3. **Get Security Audit**: Obtain third-party audit for smart contracts and app
4. **Verify Team Backgrounds**: Provide LinkedIn profiles and professional history
5. **Launch Token Trading**: Achieve 100M milestone and list on DEX/CEX
6. **Remove Recruitment Locks**: Don't gate features behind referral requirements
7. **Publish Financial Reports**: Provide transparency on treasury and prize pools
8. **Create Technical Documentation**: Publish whitepaper and technical architecture
9. **Diversify Revenue**: Reduce dependency on user recruitment for growth
