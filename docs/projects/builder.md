| **Project Name** | Builder |

| **Blockchain** | Polygon |
| **Risk Rating** | 🔴 VERY HIGH RISK |

## Project Description

Builder is a Polygon-based decentralized staking protocol with an elastic supply that expands through scheduled minting tied to new staking activity. The ecosystem positions its long-term vision around real-estate and mortgage-related use cases, where future applications may leverage the Builder community and staking system as a financial layer. Participants earn weekly rewards with principal released over long, calendar-based lockups (200 weeks), alongside referral and ambassador incentives. The protocol operates without a centralized company, with rewards driven primarily by protocol emissions rather than active mortgage cash flows.

**Tags:** DeFi Staking Protocol, Elastic Supply Token, Emission-Based Rewards, Polygon Network, Long-Term Lockups, Calendar-Based Vesting, Referral Incentive Model, Ambassador Program, Dilution Risk, Mortgage-Linked Vision

**Admins:** Josephine Barrientos, Jonahmarie, Miqoshi Onvani

## Risk Assessment Scoring

### 1. Leadership & Team Transparency (15%)
| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Founders publicly identified | 2/10 | No centralized company or identified founders; admin names only |
| Team background verifiable | 2/10 | Admins have profiles but no professional background verification |
| Advisory board disclosed | 1/10 | No advisory board disclosed |
| Company registration transparent | 1/10 | Protocol operates without centralized company structure |

**Category Score: 1.5/10**

*Justification: The project explicitly states it "operates without a centralized company" - a significant red flag. No leadership team, founders, or corporate structure is disclosed. Only admin names are visible with no verifiable professional backgrounds.*

### 2. Tokenomics & Financial Model (15%)
| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Clear token utility | 3/10 | Token used for staking rewards with unclear real utility |
| Sustainable revenue model | 1/10 | Rewards from protocol emissions, not real revenue |
| Token distribution transparency | 2/10 | Elastic supply with continuous minting creates dilution |
| Vesting schedules disclosed | 4/10 | 200-week yield minting schedule mentioned |

**Category Score: 2.5/10**

*Justification: The "elastic supply that expands through scheduled minting" is a classic inflationary tokenomics model that typically leads to significant dilution. Rewards come from "protocol emissions rather than active mortgage cash flows" - meaning no real revenue backs the yields promised. The 200-week lockup is extremely long.*

### 3. Earning Mechanism & Sustainability (10%)
| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Clear source of yields | 1/10 | Yields come from new participant deposits/minting, not real income |
| Realistic return promises | 2/10 | "Weekly rewards" with referral bonuses indicates unsustainable model |
| Withdrawal mechanisms clear | 3/10 | Principal released over "long, calendar-based lockups" |
| Historical payout evidence | 2/10 | No updates available, no payout history shown |

**Category Score: 2.0/10**

*Justification: This appears to be a classic circular rewards system where new stakers fund existing stakers' rewards. There is no real-world revenue generation from the "mortgage-linked vision" - it's positioned as future aspirations, not current reality.*

### 4. Liquidity & Exit Options (20%)
| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Exchange listings | 2/10 | No major exchange listings mentioned |
| Liquidity pool depth | 2/10 | Tags mention "Liquidity & Impermanent Loss" as risk |
| Withdrawal restrictions | 1/10 | 200-week lockup is extremely restrictive |
| Exit clarity | 2/10 | "Calendar-Based Vesting" with unclear exit process |

**Category Score: 1.75/10**

*Justification: The 200-week (nearly 4 years) lockup period is a critical red flag. This extreme lockup prevents users from exiting even if the project shows signs of failure. The project itself acknowledges "Liquidity & Impermanent Loss" as risks in its tags.*

### 5. Community & Social Proof (10%)
| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Active community size | 3/10 | Has admins and ambassador program but no engagement metrics |
| Social media presence | 3/10 | No social links provided |
| Community engagement quality | 2/10 | "No updates available for this project yet" |
| User testimonials | 2/10 | 0 upvotes, 0 downvotes shown |

**Category Score: 2.5/10**

*Justification: Despite having an "Ambassador Program," there are zero updates available and zero community engagement visible. This lack of activity for a protocol claiming to have a community is concerning.*

### 6. Technical & Security (15%)
| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Smart contract audits | N/A | No audit information provided |
| Security track record | N/A | No security information available |
| Technical documentation | 3/10 | Basic description but no technical whitepaper |
| Open source code | N/A | No GitHub or code repository mentioned |

**Category Score: 3.0/10** (adjusted for N/A items)

*Justification: Zero technical security information is provided. For a DeFi staking protocol handling user funds, the absence of any audit or security documentation is a major red flag.*

### 7. Transparency & Communication (10%)
| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Regular updates | 1/10 | "No updates available for this project yet" |
| Clear roadmap | 3/10 | Vague "mortgage-linked vision" without milestones |
| Financial reporting | 1/10 | No financial transparency |
| Response to concerns | N/A | No communication history available |

**Category Score: 1.7/10**

*Justification: The complete absence of updates despite being listed is extremely concerning. No roadmap, no financial reporting, and no communication about the project's status.*

### 8. Personal Investment Factors (5%)
| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Alignment with risk tolerance | 2/10 | Only suitable for extreme risk tolerance |
| Affordability of loss | N/A | User-specific |
| Understand the technology | 3/10 | "Caveat Emptor" tag suggests even project acknowledges risks |

**Category Score: 2.5/10**

*Justification: The project itself includes "Caveat Emptor" (buyer beware) as a tag, which is an unusual admission. This suggests even the team acknowledges significant risk.*

## Risk Rating: 🔴 VERY HIGH RISK

This project exhibits characteristics consistent with Ponzi-like schemes:
- Rewards from emissions rather than real revenue
- Extreme lockup periods preventing exit
- No verifiable company or leadership
- "Caveat Emptor" self-acknowledgment of risk

---

## Major Red Flags 🚩

1. **No Corporate Structure**: Project explicitly operates "without a centralized company" - no legal recourse for investors
2. **Emission-Based Rewards**: All yields come from token minting and new participant capital, not real revenue
3. **200-Week Lockup**: Nearly 4-year lockup is extreme and traps investor capital
4. **No Updates**: Zero project updates despite being listed
5. **Dilution Risk**: Elastic supply with continuous minting dilutes existing holders
6. **"Caveat Emptor" Tag**: Project warns buyers to beware - unusual self-admission
7. **Vaporware Vision**: "Mortgage-linked vision" is aspirational with no current implementation
8. **Referral-Heavy Model**: Ambassador and referral incentives suggest recruitment dependency

---

## Steps to Improve Score

1. **Establish Legal Entity**: Register a proper company with transparent corporate structure
2. **Identify Leadership**: Publicly disclose and verify founders and executive team
3. **Get Security Audit**: Obtain third-party smart contract audit from reputable firm
4. **Create Real Revenue**: Develop actual mortgage/real-estate revenue before promising returns
5. **Reduce Lockups**: Implement more reasonable vesting periods (weeks/months, not years)
6. **Publish Regular Updates**: Establish consistent communication schedule
7. **Achieve Exchange Listings**: Get listed on recognized exchanges for liquidity
8. **Provide Financial Transparency**: Publish regular financial reports and treasury status
9. **Remove "Caveat Emptor"**: Address underlying risks rather than warning about them
