## Major Red Flags 🚩

1. **Miqoshi Onvani Admin Connection**: Same admin manages multiple high-risk projects on iiZR platform (Builder, iiZR Playbook, TEXITcoin)
2. **Proprietary "Gogical" Methods**: Unverified educational methodology with no external validation
3. **Vague Earning Claims**: "Earn More" messaging without clear mechanisms
4. **No Team Background Verification**: Instructors mentioned but credentials not verifiable
5. **XP/Quest System**: Zealy integration creates gamification without clear value
6. **Subscription Lock-in**: Insights require subscription with unknown terms
7. **"Gold Standard" Claims**: Marketing language without substantiation

---

1. **Educational Focus**: Lower direct financial risk than token investments
2. **Active Content Development**: 7 updates with course materials
3. **Community Engagement**: Live classes with student participation
4. **Multi-Chain Expansion**: Moving to Solana suggests development

---

## Steps to Improve Score
