## Project Description

SQWL positions itself as the "Gold Standard of Crypto Education" built on proprietary "Gogical" techniques and learning processes. The platform claims to use a "Gogy" framework for information retention, helping students absorb blockchain concepts. The value proposition includes education, community connection, and earning opportunities with principles: "Be Safe. Have Fun. Earn More."

**Analysis Note:** Prior assessment referenced an incorrect website (sqwl.ai). The correct site is https://www.sqewl.com/. Public pages do not explicitly disclose a native token or tokenomics, and key details appear gated behind registration.
