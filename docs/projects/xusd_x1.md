## Recommendations

### ⛔ DO NOT INVEST - CONFIRMED SCAM

   - Document all transactions immediately
   - Consult legal counsel about joining potential class action
   - Report losses to FBI IC3 (Internet Crime Complaint Center)
   - File complaints with SEC and state securities regulators

2. **For Prospective Investors:**
   - This project is 100% confirmed as fraudulent
   - Do not attempt to interact with any related platforms
   - Report any solicitations to appropriate authorities

3. **Warning Signs to Remember:**
   - Multiple leadership arrests should end all consideration
   - Federal fraud indictments confirm scam status
   - Offline platforms with no communication = exit scam complete

## Verdict

**🔴 CRITICAL RISK (0.5/10)** - This is a confirmed federal fraud case, not a speculation. XUSD/X1 is no longer an investment opportunity but a criminal prosecution. Multiple key figures have been arrested, indicted with 165+ counts, and the platform has ceased operations. This represents a complete and total loss scenario. Do not invest under any circumstances. If you have funds in this project, they are likely unrecoverable. Seek legal counsel immediately.
