## Risk Assessment Scoring

### 1. Leadership & Team Transparency (15%)
| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Founders publicly identified | 3/10 | No verified founder bios |
| Team background verifiable | 4/10 | No leadership LinkedIn or credentials shown in sources |
| Advisory board disclosed | 5/10 | $10M seed round from Peak XV, DST Global mentioned |
| Company registration transparent | 6/10 | Appears to be registered company with banking partnerships |

**Category Score: 4.5/10**

*Justification: The project has VC backing, but leadership identities are not verified in the available sources.*

### 2. Tokenomics & Financial Model (15%)
| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Clear token utility | 6/10 | KAST Points earned on spending; convertible to tokens in 2026 |
| Sustainable revenue model | 7/10 | Transaction fees from card usage provide real revenue |
| Token distribution transparency | 5/10 | Points-to-token conversion planned but details unclear |
| Vesting schedules disclosed | 4/10 | Token conversion in 2026 mentioned without details |

**Category Score: 5.5/10**

*Justification: The business model is clear - transaction fees from card usage generate real revenue. The KAST Points system with 2026 token conversion adds speculative element but doesn't undermine core business.*

### 3. Earning Mechanism & Sustainability (10%)
| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Clear source of yields | 7/10 | 2% KAST Points + 4% $MOVE tokens on transactions |
| Realistic return promises | 7/10 | Cashback rewards are standard fintech model |
| Withdrawal mechanisms clear | 7/10 | Standard card spending; crypto withdrawal options |
| Historical payout evidence | 6/10 | Regular updates show active features and campaigns |

**Category Score: 6.75/10**

*Justification: The earning mechanism mirrors traditional credit card cashback programs, which is a proven and sustainable model. The 4% $MOVE promotion is time-limited and clearly disclosed as promotional.*

### 4. Liquidity & Exit Options (20%)
| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Exchange listings | 6/10 | $MOVE tradable on Binance, OKX, Bybit |

| Exit clarity | 7/10 | KAST Pay allows bank transfers to 200+ countries |

**Category Score: 6.25/10**

*Justification: The core product (stablecoin spending) has excellent liquidity - users can always withdraw to bank accounts. KAST Points have no current liquidity but this is clearly disclosed.*

### 5. Community & Social Proof (10%)
| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Active community size | 7/10 | 500k users claimed on site; active social presence |
| Social media presence | 7/10 | Active Twitter account with regular engagement |

### 6. Technical & Security (15%)
| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|

| Open source code | N/A | Proprietary fintech product |

**Category Score: 6.0/10** (adjusted for N/A items)

| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Alignment with risk tolerance | 7/10 | Mainstream fintech product with crypto elements |
| Affordability of loss | 7/10 | Standard cards free; premium cards $40-$100+ |

## Risk Rating: 🟡 MODERATE RISK

This is a legitimate fintech product with strong VC backing, but carries moderate risk due to limited leadership verification and points-to-token conversion uncertainty.

---

## Major Red Flags 🚩

1. **Points-to-Token Uncertainty**: KAST Points will convert to tokens in 2026 with unspecified terms
2. **Regulatory Risk**: Crypto cards face evolving global regulations
3. **Limited Team Verification**: Team names provided but limited background verification
4. **Card Fees**: Premium cards cost $100+ plus shipping
5. **Country Restrictions**: Some features may not be available in all 160+ countries
6. **Staking Requirements**: SOL staking bonuses may encourage overexposure

---

## Positive Indicators ✅

1. **$10M VC Funding**: Backed by Peak XV (Sequoia India) and DST Global
2. **Working Product**: Live app with virtual and physical cards
3. **Visa Partnership**: Legitimate payment rail integration

5. **Multi-Chain Support**: Solana, BNB Chain, with more planned
6. **Apple Pay/Google Pay**: Mainstream payment integration
7. **Active Development**: Regular feature releases and updates
8. **Real Revenue Model**: Transaction fees from card usage
9. **Bank Integration**: SPEI (Mexico), local bank withdrawals in multiple currencies
10. **Stablecoin Focus**: Reduces crypto volatility risk

---

## Steps to Improve Score

2. **Clarify Token Economics**: Detail the KAST Points to token conversion terms
3. **Obtain Security Audits**: Get third-party security certification
4. **Publish Financial Reports**: Provide transparency on transaction volumes and revenue
5. **Reduce Premium Card Costs**: Lower barrier to physical card access
6. **Expand Documentation**: Create comprehensive technical and security documentation
